AutoAI Model Building – Insurance Charges Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of IBM Watson Studio AutoAI for predicting insurance charges.
Two exported notebooks are provided:

Pipeline 5 Notebook – the code for the best-performing pipeline automatically generated by AutoAI.

Complete AutoAI Notebook – the full experiment including all pipelines, feature engineering, and leaderboard results.

The goal is to highlight how AutoAI automates the end-to-end ML pipeline, from preprocessing to deployment.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset used is insurance.csv, which contains:

Feature	Type	Description
age	Numeric	Age of the insured person
sex	Categorical	Gender (male/female)
bmi	Numeric	Body mass index
children	Numeric	Number of children covered
smoker	Categorical	Smoking status (yes/no)
region	Categorical	Residential region
charges	Numeric	Target variable – insurance charges
⚙️ Methodology
🔹 Pipeline 5 Notebook (_P5 - XGB Regressor_ Insurance_Charge.ipynb)

Exported directly from AutoAI as the best pipeline.

Uses XGBoost Regressor.

Contains preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, and evaluation code.

Can be run independently to reproduce results from the winning pipeline.

🔹 Complete AutoAI Notebook (AutoAI_Insurance_Model.ipynb)

Exported from a full AutoAI experiment in Watson Studio.

Shows:

Data preprocessing steps

Feature engineering

Multiple pipelines generated (Random Forest, LightGBM, SnapML, XGBoost, etc.)

Leaderboard ranking pipelines by RMSE

Identifies Pipeline 5 as the best model.

🏆 Results

Best Model: XGBoost Regressor (Pipeline 5)

Target column: charges

Evaluation metric: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

AutoAI achieved better performance than manual ML coding by:

Automating preprocessing

Testing multiple algorithms

Hyperparameter tuning

Key predictors of insurance charges:

smoker (highest impact)

bmi

age

children

(Exact RMSE and R² values can be checked in the notebooks.)
